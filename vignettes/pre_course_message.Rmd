Hello All,

I'm looking forward to teaching the course next week.

It's fine that we will have participants with different existing experience with R and there will be material for different levels. I'll encourage you to take things at your own pace with plenty of hands-on time.

However, that said, I will not have time in the session to address issues about installing R, RStudio or the recomended packages. You'll need to get that done beforehand.

So, before the course could you do the following A) Essential and B) Helpful things :

A) Essential
Have R and RStudio installed (links from here : https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#R)

Be familiar with R basics OR have gone through chapters 1 & 2 at http://tryr.codeschool.com/

Install these packages with this command from R :
install.packages(c("ggplot2","tmap","leaflet"), dependencies=TRUE)


B) Helpful for more advanced

You have the latest version of R (3.3.1)

If you are bringing your own data, have it already read into R (using read.csv or similar) as a dataframe with named columns. I will have limited time to address data import or formatting issues. There will be example data for you to work with too.


Best wishes,
Andy
