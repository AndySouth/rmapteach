### Installation 

You probably wouldn't want to install this as a package. Instead you are more likely to want to just access documents from github as shown above. However this would be a quick way of getting everything locally.

    #install.packages("devtools")
    require(devtools)    
    install_github('AndySouth/rmapteach')  
    require(rmapteach)
